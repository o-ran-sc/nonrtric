# O-RAN-SC NonRT RIC Dashboard Web Application

The O-RAN NonRT RIC PolicyAgent provides a REST API for management of 
policices. It provides support for 
-Policy configuration. This includes
 -One REST API towards all RICs in the network
 -Query functions that can find all policies in a RIC, all policies owned by a service (R-APP), all policies of a type etc.
 -Maps O1 resources (ManagedElement) as defined in O1 to the controlling RIC 
-Supervision of clients (R-APPs) to eliminate stray policies in case of failure
-Consistency monitoring of the SMO view of policies and the actual situation in the RICs
-Consistency monitoring of RIC capabilities (policy types)

To Run Policy Agent in Local:
Create a symbolic link with below command,
ln -s <path to test_application_configuration.json> application_configuration.json

The agent can be run stand alone in a simulated test mode. Then it 
simulates RICs. 
The REST API is published on port 8081 and it is started by command:
mvn -Dtest=MockPolicyAgent test

The backend server publishes live API documentation at the
URL `http://your-host-name-here:8080/swagger-ui.html`
