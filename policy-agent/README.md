# O-RAN-SC Non-RT RIC Policy Agent

The O-RAN Non-RT RIC PolicyAgent provides a REST API for management of policices.
It provides support for:
 -Supervision of clients (R-APPs) to eliminate stray policies in case of failure
 -Consistency monitoring of the SMO view of policies and the actual situation in the RICs
 -Consistency monitoring of RIC capabilities (policy types)
 -Policy configuration. This includes:
  -One REST API towards all RICs in the network
  -Query functions that can find all policies in a RIC, all policies owned by a service (R-APP),
   all policies of a type etc.
  -Maps O1 resources (ManagedElement) as defined in O1 to the controlling RIC

The Policy Agent uses the default keystore and truststore that are built into the container. The paths and passwords for these stores are located in a yaml file:
nonrtric/policy-agent/config/application.yaml

The default truststore includes a1simulator cert as a trusted cert which is located here:
https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=sim/a1-interface.git;a=tree;f=near-rt-ric-simulator/certificate;h=172c1e5aacd52d760e4416288dc5648a5817ce65;hb=HEAD

The default truststore also includes a1controller cert as a trusted cert which is located here (keystore.jks file):
https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=nonrtric.git;a=tree;f=sdnc-a1-controller/oam/installation/sdnc-a1/src/main/resources;h=17fdf6cecc7a866c5ce10a35672b742a9f0c4acf;hb=HEAD

There is also Policy Agent's own cert in the default truststore for mocking purposes and unit-testing (ApplicationTest.java).

The default keystore, truststore, and application.yaml files can be overridden by mounting new files using the "volumes" field of docker-compose or docker run command.

Assuming that the keystore, truststore, and application.yaml files are located in the same directory as docker-compose, the volumes field should have these entries:

volumes:
      - ./new_keystore.jks:/opt/app/policy-agent/etc/cert/keystore.jks:ro
      - ./new_truststore.jks:/opt/app/policy-agent/etc/cert/truststore.jks:ro
      - ./new_application.yaml:/opt/app/policy-agent/config/application.yaml:ro

The target paths in the container should not be modified.

Example docker run command for mounting new files (assuming they are located in the current directory):
docker run -p 8081:8081 -p 8433:8433 --name=policy-agent-container --network=nonrtric-docker-net --volume "$PWD/new_keystore.jks:/opt/app/policy-agent/etc/cert/keystore.jks" --volume "$PWD/new_truststore.jks:/opt/app/policy-agent/etc/cert/truststore.jks" --volume "$PWD/new_application.yaml:/opt/app/policy-agent/config/application.yaml" o-ran-sc/nonrtric-policy-agent:2.2.1-SNAPSHOT


To Run Policy Agent in Local:
In the folder /opt/app/policy-agent/config/, create a soft link with below command,
ln -s <path to test_application_configuration.json> application_configuration.json

To Run Policy Agent in Local with the DMaaP polling turned on:
In the folder /opt/app/policy-agent/config/, create a soft link with below command,
ln -s <path to test_application_configuration_with_dmaap_config.json> application_configuration.json

The agent can be run stand alone in a simulated test mode. Then it simulates RICs.
The REST API is published on port 8081 and it is started by command:
mvn -Dtest=MockPolicyAgent test

The backend server publishes live API documentation at the
URL `http://your-host-name-here:8081/swagger-ui.html`

PolicyAgent uses A1-POLICY-AGENT-READ & A1-POLICY-AGENT-WRITE topic for subscribe & Publish to the DMaap.
