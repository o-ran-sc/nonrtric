## Overview
The bash scripts in this dir are intended for function test of the Non-RT RIC in different configurations, using simulators when needed for the external interfaces.
A few of the bash scripts are so called 'suites', These suite scripts calls a sequence of the other bash scripts.

## Automated test scripts
There are two types of scripts, filenames in the format FTCXXX.sh test one or more components of the Non-RT RIC. Filenames in the format SuiteZZZZ.sh tests a number of FTCXXX.sh script as one suite. (XXX is an integer selected from the categories described further below).
FTC is short for Function Test Case. In addition, there are also other test scripts with other naming format used for demo setup etc (e.g PM_DEMO.sh).

The requirements, in terms of the execution enviroment, to run a script or a suite is to have docker, docker-compose and python3 installed (the scripts warns if not installed). As an option, the scripts can also be executed in a Minikube or Kubernetes installation. The additional requirement is to have a clean minikube/kubernetes installation, perferably with the kube dashboard installed.
The scripts have been tested to work on both MacOS and Ubuntu using docker. They should work also in git-bash on windows (for docker) but only partly verified. Running using minikube has only been verified on Ubuntu and running on kubernetes has only been verified on MacOS.

## Configuration
The test scripts uses configuration from a single file, found in `../common/test_env.sh`, which contains all needed configuration in terms of image names, image tags, ports, file paths, passwords etc. This file can be modified if needed.  See the README.md in  `../common/` for all details of the config file.

## How to run
A test script, for example FTC1, is executed from the cmd line using the script filename and one or more parameters:

 ./FTC1.sh remote docker --env-file ../common/test_env-oran-cherry.sh

Note that is running on a released verion, the parameter "release" shall be included to run the released images.

See the README.md in  `../common/` for all details about available parameters and their meaning.

Each test script prints out the overall result of the tests in the end of the execution.

The test scripts produce quite a number of logs; all container logs, a log of all http/htps calls from the test scripts including the payload, some configuration created during test and also a test case log (same as what is printed on the screen during execution). All these logs are stored in `logs/FTCXXX/`. So each test script is using its own log directory.

To test all components on a very basic level, run the demo test script(s) for the desired release.
Note that oran tests only include components from oran.
Note that onap test uses components from onap combined with released oran components available at that onap release (e.g. Honolulu contains onap images from honolulu and oran images from cherry)
```
ORAN CHERRY
===========
./PM_EI_DEMO.sh remote-remove  docker release   --env-file ../common/test_env-oran-cherry.sh
./PM_EI_DEMO.sh remote-remove  kube  release --env-file ../common/test_env-oran-cherry.sh

ORAN DAWN
=========
./PM_EI_DEMO.sh remote-remove  docker   --env-file ../common/test_env-oran-dawn.sh  --use-release-image SDNC
./PM_EI_DEMO.sh remote-remove  kube   --env-file ../common/test_env-oran-dawn.sh  --use-release-image SDNC
Note that dawn has not update the SDNC so cherry release is used
Note: When dawn is released, add the 'release' arg to run released images.

ONAP GUILIN
===========
./PM_DEMO.sh remote-remove  docker release   --env-file ../common/test_env-onap-guilin.sh
./PM_DEMO.sh remote-remove  kube  release --env-file ../common/test_env-onap-guilin.sh
Note that ECS was not available before oran cherry so a test script without ECS is used.

ONAP HONOLULU
=============
./PM_EI_DEMO.sh remote-remove  docker   --env-file ../common/test_env-onap-honolulu.sh
./PM_EI_DEMO.sh remote-remove  kube   --env-file ../common/test_env-onap-honolulu.sh
Note: When honolulu is released, add the 'release' arg to run released images.
```
## Test case categories
The test script are number using these basic categories where 0-999 are releated to the policy managment and 1000-1999 are related to enrichment management. 2000-2999 are for southbound http proxy. There are also demo test cases that test more or less all components. These test scripts does not use the numbering scheme below.

The numbering in each series corresponds to the following groupings
1-99 - Basic sanity tests

100-199 - API tests

300-399 - Config changes and sync

800-899 - Stability and capacity test

900-999 - Misc test

Suites

To get an overview of the available test scripts, use the following command to print the test script description:
'grep ONELINE *.sh' in the dir of the test scripts.

## Test case file - template
A test script contains a number of steps to verify a certain functionality.
The empty template for a test case file looks like this.
Only the parts noted with < and > shall be changed.
It is strongly suggested to look at the existing test scripts, it is probably easier to copy an existing test script instead of creating one from scratch. The README.md in  `../common/` describes the functions available in the test script in detail.
