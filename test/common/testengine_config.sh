#   Note than an app might use more than one image
# 2 Add the short name to APP_SHORT_NAMES
# 3 If the image is built and released as part of the project,
#   add the short name to PROJECT_IMAGES
# 4 If it possible to override with for example  a local image,
#   add the short name to AVAILABLE_IMAGES_OVERRIDE
