      "message": "I dont see thee need to make a simple gets synchronized. I general, methods modifying common data or iterate over common data need to be protected. But once this config is fetched by a thread, the contents can still be modified by that thread and causing problem to another thread that has fecthed the same properties. I guess in this case, the config is modified only by one thread (the thread reading the config) and if other threads are just reading the data. However, it could be a problem if the data is updated when the other threads does not expect the data to be changed.",
