# O-RAN-SC Non-RealTime RIC - A1 Controller

SDNC-A1 controller provides a Northbound Interface for A1 operations to do policy management in Near-RealTime RICs.

It is a very lightweight version of ONAP SDNC.

Many features/components of SDNC that are not needed for A1 operations have been removed from both northbound and oam directories.

This makes it very fast to start the controller and also puts less load on the CPU.

Please see the documentation in the docs/ folder
