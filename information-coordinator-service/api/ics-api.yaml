  title: Data management and exposure
  description: <h1>API documentation</h1><h2>General</h2><p>  The service is mainly
    a broker between data producers and data consumers. A data producer has the ability
    to produce one or several types of data (Information Type). One type of data can
    be produced by zero to many producers. <br /><br />A data consumer can have several
    active data subscriptions (Information Job). One Information Job consists of the
    type of data to produce and additional parameters for filtering of the data. These
    parameters are different for different data types.</p><h2>APIs provided by the
    service</h2><h4>A1-EI</h4><p>  This API is between Near-RT RIC and the Non-RT
    RIC.  The Near-RT RIC is a data consumer, which creates Information Jobs to subscribe
    for data.  In this context, the information is referred to as 'Enrichment Information',
    EI.</p><h4>Data producer API</h4><p>  This API is provided by the Non-RT RIC platform
    and is intended to be part of the O-RAN R1 interface.  The API is for use by different
    kinds of data producers and provides support for:<ul><li>Registry of supported
    information types and which parameters needed to setup a subscription.</li><li>Registry
    of existing data producers.</li><li>Callback API provided by producers to setup
    subscriptions.</li></ul></p><h4>Data consumer API</h4><p>  This API is provided
    by the Non-RT RIC platform and is intended to be part of the O-RAN R1 interface.  The
    API is for use by different kinds of data consumers and provides support for:<ul><li>Querying
    of available types of data to consume.</li><li>Management of data subscription
    jobs</li><li>Optional callback API provided by consumers to get notification on
    added and removed information types.</li></ul></p><h4>Service status</h4><p>  This
    API provides a means to monitor the health of this service.</p>
