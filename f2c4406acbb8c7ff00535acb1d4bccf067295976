      "message": "Generally when setting up expectations on a mock it is best to not specify the values of the parameters, but instead use anyString() in this case. The reason for this is that the values are verified in the verify call after the code to test has been executed. So there will only be one place that the verification is done. This goes for all tests below also. If there is no matching specific argumetn matcher, like anyString(), for the type in question, use any(NameOfClass.class) so that type safety is maintaned.",

      "message": "As per my understanding, the verification is still done in one place, i.e., the verify call. Here, it just specifies that if you get a call with these parameters, then return this. There is no verification involved here. Hence, there is nothing wrong if you match the parameters for mock calls. I have seen many examples on the web doing the same. So, I don\u0027t think that it is a standard practice.\n\nSecondly, I think it is also simpler to match parameters when calling mock methods with generic parameters, e.g., getForEntity in this case.",
